# To farm regular League pass EXP (that has tokens) it is recommended to leave this on false,

# To farm TFT pass EXP it is recommended to set this to true,

# By default, the bot only looks for the next trait in the list if the trait that comes

# You can disable that behavior by setting this to false, which will equally attempt

# The only reason you would set this is if all of these conditions apply:

# 3. The bot is unable to determine the League installation path by itself
