# Whether to surrender as soon as possible.
# To farm regular League pass EXP (that has tokens) it is recommended to leave this on false,
# since the repeating mission gives out EXP based on playtime and winning (being top 4).
# To farm TFT pass EXP it is recommended to set this to true,
# since the TFT pass receives a flat 100 EXP per normal tft game played, regardless of any other factors.
# The CLI flag -f/--ffearly will override this.

# Override where League is installed.
# The only reason you would set this is if all of these conditions apply:
# 1. You're initially starting the bot while the League Client is closed
# 2. You want the bot to start the League Client for you
# 3. The bot is unable to determine the League installation path by itself
